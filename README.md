# network_analysis_workshop
Materials for a workshop on network analysis using Gephi. I also use material from [Thomas Padilla and Brandon Locke's excellent Gephi workshop] (http://thomaspadilla.org/na2014/).  

I don't provide a dataset for this workshop because students create it themselves by answering a few questions about their preferences. See the "Creating the Dataset" document for more information on how to do this.
