# network_analysis_workshop
Materials for an introductory workshop on network analysis using Gephi. (You could easily modify these materials to use another tool.) I also use material from [Thomas Padilla and Brandon Locke's excellent Gephi workshop] (http://thomaspadilla.org/na2014/).  

I don't provide a dataset for this workshop because students create it themselves by answering a few questions about their preferences. See the "Creating the Dataset" document for more information on how to do this.  

I've included the workshop handout, called "Creating a Network Graph with Gephi," as both a .docx and PDF, a glossary of some network-analysis terms, and instructions on how to have the students create the dataset.
